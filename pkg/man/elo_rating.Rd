  a,
  b,
  winner = c("a", "b"),
  ml = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{a}{Elo rating of player a before match}

\item{b}{Elo rating of player b before match}

\item{winner}{whether A or B is the winner}

\item{ml}{is match length}

\item{axp}{total match lengths (experience) of player a until this match}

\item{bxp}{total match lengths (experience) of player b until this match}

\item{a_adv}{any arbitrary advantage that player a gets on top of the usual comparison of ratings,

# baptism by fire; a's rating should be 1540.95 after beating a master player:
round(elo_rating(a = 1500, b = 1925, ml = 7, axp = 0, bxp = 10000, winner = "a")$a, 2)

# short game where b has a home town advantage of 0.1
elo_rating(1500, 1500, a_adv = -0.1)
