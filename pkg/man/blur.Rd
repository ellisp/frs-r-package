\title{One-dimensional convolution}
\usage{
blur(x, cvv, warnings = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of counts or other numbers}

\item{cvv}{a vector of probabilities to convolve x at various lags. First value should be for lag 0, 
second for lag 1, etc. (stands for "convolution vector")}

\item{warnings}{whether to show warnings when the resulting vector does not add up to the
same sum as the original}
}
\value{
A vector of length equal to the length of x plus length of cvv minus 1
}

x <- c(4,6,8,9,7,5)
cvv <- c(0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2)
